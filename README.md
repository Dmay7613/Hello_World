# Hello GitHub World

Introductory Repository

I'm currently Grad Student at the University of Iowa. I am participating in a dual Master's Degree program in Finance and Business Analytics. I want to grow my data analytics skillset, in order to feel  prepared to enter this industry once I've graduated.

I am currently learning Python and SQL this semster and plan on learning R next semester. I have developed a passion for data analytics and how business' can use these analyses to better their company's overall performance.

I will learn more about GitHub as I pursue my Masters' Degrees, so I know how to effectively use this platform to develop and hone my data analytics skillset.
